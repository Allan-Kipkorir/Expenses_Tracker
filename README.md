Here is a draft GitHub README for your React Expenses Tracker app:

# Expenses Tracker

This is a simple expense tracking app built with React. Users can add expenses and view graphs of their spending over time. 

## Features

- Add new expenses by entering a description, category, and amount
- Expenses are shown in a table listing description, category, amount, and date
- A bar chart shows total spending for each month
- Expenses can be filtered by year
- Chart and table update when new expenses are added

## Usage

To use the app:

- Enter expense details into the form 
- Select a category like food, rent, bills, etc
- Click "Add Expense" to add to table and chart
- Use the "Filter by Year" select to view different years
- Expenses are saved to localStorage so they persist on refresh

The app is fully responsive for mobile and desktop viewing.

## Implementation 

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Key technologies used:

- React Hooks for state management
- React-Chartjs-2 for data visualization  
- uuid to generate unique IDs
- LocalStorage API to persist data
- React Bootstrap for styling

## Potential Improvements

Some ways this app could be enhanced:

- Allow editing and removal of expenses
- Add user accounts with login/logout
- Server backend to store expenses in a database
- More advanced charting with trends, averages, etc
- Improve mobile experience
